# cats-cats-cats

A completely harmless and mostly useless Leiningen template that adds cats to your project.

## Usage

Just run it with lein

```sh
$ lein new cats-cats-cats dogs
```

Enjoy the cats!

## Is this good?

Yes! It adds a cat gif to your project! How is that not good?

## Future Plans

- more cats
